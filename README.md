Sources of coherent, monochromatic, narrowband radiation that is tunable at a desirable wavelength are not readily available. This problem is eminent when it reaches the demands of the current research: size, intensity, and robustness. Josephson Junctions in combination with resonators can be utilized for this purpose.
